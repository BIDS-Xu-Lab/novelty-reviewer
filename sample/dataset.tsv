29149684	A new tool to detect money laundering criminals is proposed in this paper. The tool is tested in the context of a real case.
23390963	An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to purify the native map-HBHA from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The availability of this antigen offers the possibility to study the structure of the protein and to examine its role in pathogenicity, in particular to better understand the specific interactions of Map with the intestinal tissue. The map-HBHA obtained in its native immunogenic form may also be useful to improve the diagnostic test, especially for the development of a new T-cell-based interferon gamma release assays.
34434660	This study demonstrated that ferroptosis-related gene signatures can be used as a potential predictor for the prognosis of LUAD, thus providing a novel strategy for individualized treatment in LUAD patients.
15291097	Five cDNA sequences were found PTS related. 3 of them may represent the genes that are either identical or nearly identical to previously reported genes The other 2 sequences are most probably new sequences not existing in GenBank DNA database, which have been registered in the GenBank DNA database as new sequences.
26241312	Taken together, our data demonstrate, for the first time, that SS mice display features of urinary bladder dysfunction, leading to impairment in urinary continence, which may have an important role in the pathogenesis of the enuresis and infections observed the SCD patients.
