Combining Benford's Law and machine learning to detect money laundering. An actual Spanish court case.	Forensic science international	2018 Jan	OBJECTIVES: This paper is based on the analysis of the database of operations from a macro-case on money laundering orchestrated between a core company and a group of its suppliers, 26 of which had already been identified by the police as fraudulent companies. In the face of a well-founded suspicion that more companies have perpetrated criminal acts and in order to make better use of what are very limited police resources, we aim to construct a tool to detect money laundering criminals.<br><br>METHODS: We combine Benford's Law and machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks, and random forests) to find patterns of money laundering criminals in the context of a real Spanish court case.<br><br>RESULTS: After mapping each supplier's set of accounting data into a 21-dimensional space using Benford's Law and applying machine learning algorithms, additional companies that could merit further scrutiny are flagged up.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS: A new tool to detect money laundering criminals is proposed in this paper. The tool is tested in the context of a real case.	New sequence	1/29/2025, 5:02:45 PM	human	New sequence										sample_prompt.txt	sample_taxonomy.txt
23390963	An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to purify the native map-HBHA from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The availability of this antigen offers the possibility to study the structure of the protein and to examine its role in pathogenicity, in particular to better understand the specific interactions of Map with the intestinal tissue. The map-HBHA obtained in its native immunogenic form may also be useful to improve the diagnostic test, especially for the development of a new T-cell-based interferon gamma release assays.	Purification of native HBHA from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.	BMC research notes	2013 Feb 7	BACKGROUND: Paratuberculosis remains today a major global problem in animal health, especially for dairy cattle. However, the diagnosis of its etiologic agent, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), still lacks sensitivity because of the lack of available antigens. Little is known about the virulence factors for this pathogen. In this study we have developed a method to produce and purify the heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a major adhesin of Mycobacteria, from a culture of Map.<br><br>FINDINGS: For this extremely slow-growing Mycobacterium, a culture was established in a 3-liter bioreactor. Using the bioreactor the amount of the Map biomass was increased 5-fold compared to a classical culture in flasks. The map-HBHA was purified from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography on HiTrap columns. Binding of map-HBHA onto heparin-Sepharose can be reduced in the presence of salt. Consequently, all steps of sample preparation and column equilibration were carried out in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). The map-HBHA was eluted by a linear NaCl gradient. High resolution mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the native form of map-HBHA has posttranslational modifications, including the removal of the initiation methionine, acetylation of the alanine residue at the N-terminal extremity and the presence of methylated lysines in the C-terminal domain of the protein.<br><br>CONCLUSIONS: An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to purify the native map-HBHA from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography.

The researchers developed a novel experimental method for Map culture (using a bioreactor instead of traditional flask culture) 2. They established a new purification technique for map-HBHA using specific chromatography steps 3. The method increases biomass yield (5-fold increase compared to classical culture) 4. The conclusion explicitly highlights the novelty of the approach by describing the optimized culture and purification technique 5. The method offers potential improvements in studying protein structure, pathogenicity, and diagnostic test development  The most specific sub-label that captures the novelty is ""New experimental method"" under the broader category of ""New research method"" within the ""Method and Material Novelty"" primary label."

MedTator: a serverless annotation tool for corpus development.	Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)	2022 Mar 4	SUMMARY: Building a high-quality annotation corpus requires expenditure of considerable time and expertise, particularly for biomedical and clinical research applications. Most existing annotation tools provide many advanced features to cover a variety of needs where the installation, integration and difficulty of use present a significant burden for actual annotation tasks. Here, we present MedTator, a serverless annotation tool, aiming to provide an intuitive and interactive user interface that focuses on the core steps related to corpus annotation, such as document annotation, corpus summarization, annotation export and annotation adjudication.<br><br>AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: MedTator and its tutorial are freely available from https://ohnlp.github.io/MedTator.
