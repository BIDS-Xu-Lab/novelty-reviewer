Electronic address: pavia@uv.es.<br><br>OBJECTIVES: This paper is based on the analysis of the database of operations <br>from a macro-case on money laundering orchestrated between a core company and a <br>group of its suppliers, 26 of which had already been identified by the police as <br>fraudulent companies. In the face of a well-founded suspicion that more <br>companies have perpetrated criminal acts and in order to make better use of what <br>are very limited police resources, we aim to construct a tool to detect money <br>laundering criminals.<br>METHODS: We combine Benford's Law and machine learning algorithms (logistic <br>regression, decision trees, neural networks, and random forests) to find <br>patterns of money laundering criminals in the context of a real Spanish court <br>case.<br>RESULTS: After mapping each supplier's set of accounting data into a <br>21-dimensional space using Benford's Law and applying machine learning <br>algorithms, additional companies that could merit further scrutiny are flagged <br>up.<br>CONCLUSIONS: A new tool to detect money laundering criminals is proposed in this <br>paper. The tool is tested in the context of a real case.<br><br>Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

23390963	An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to purify the native map-HBHA from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. The availability of this antigen offers the possibility to study the structure of the protein and to examine its role in pathogenicity, in particular to better understand the specific interactions of Map with the intestinal tissue. The map-HBHA obtained in its native immunogenic form may also be useful to improve the diagnostic test, especially for the development of a new T-cell-based interferon gamma release assays.	Purification of native HBHA from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.	BMC research notes	2013 Feb 7	1. BMC Res Notes. 2013 Feb 7;6:55. doi: 10.1186/1756-0500-6-55.<br><br>Purification of native HBHA from Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.<br><br>Lefrancois LH(1), Bodier CC, Lecher S, Gilbert FB, Cochard T, Harichaux G, Labas <br>V, Teixeira-Gomes AP, Raze D, Locht C, Biet F.<br><br>Author information:<br>(1)INRA, UMR ISP 1282 Infectiologie et Santé Publique, Nouzilly F-37380, France. <br>Franck.Biet@tours.inra.fr<br><br>BACKGROUND: Paratuberculosis remains today a major global problem in animal <br>health, especially for dairy cattle. However, the diagnosis of its etiologic <br>agent, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map), still lacks <br>sensitivity because of the lack of available antigens. Little is known about the <br>virulence factors for this pathogen. In this study we have developed a method to <br>produce and purify the heparin-binding hemagglutinin (HBHA), a major adhesin of <br>Mycobacteria, from a culture of Map.<br>FINDINGS: For this extremely slow-growing Mycobacterium, a culture was <br>established in a 3-liter bioreactor. Using the bioreactor the amount of the Map <br>biomass was increased 5-fold compared to a classical culture in flasks. The <br>map-HBHA was purified from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose chromatography on <br>HiTrap columns. Binding of map-HBHA onto heparin-Sepharose can be reduced in the <br>presence of salt. Consequently, all steps of sample preparation and column <br>equilibration were carried out in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.2). The map-HBHA was <br>eluted by a linear NaCl gradient. High resolution mass spectrometry analyses <br>revealed that the native form of map-HBHA has posttranslational modifications, <br>including the removal of the initiation methionine, acetylation of the alanine <br>residue at the N-terminal extremity and the presence of methylated lysines in <br>the C-terminal domain of the protein.<br>CONCLUSIONS: An optimized culture of Map in a bioreactor was established to <br>purify the native map-HBHA from a Map lysate by heparin-Sepharose <br>chromatography. The availability of this antigen offers the possibility to study <br>the structure of the protein and to examine its role in pathogenicity, in <br>particular to better understand the specific interactions of Map with the <br>intestinal tissue. The map-HBHA obtained in its native immunogenic form may also <br>be useful to improve the diagnostic test, especially for the development of a <br>new T-cell-based interferon gamma release assays.<br><br>DOI: 10.1186/1756-0500-6-55<br>PMCID: PMC3586368<br>PMID: 23390963 [Indexed for MEDLINE]	New application method	11/19/2024, 12:53:38 PM	openai	New cell	New application method	"{     ""category"": ""New application method"",     ""reason"": ""The conclusion discusses the development of a culture method that allows for the purification of map-HBHA, which could improve diagnostic tests and facilitate the study of pathogenicity."",     ""full_category_structure"": ""Method and Material Novelty - New application method - New therapy"" }"	The conclusion discusses the development of a culture method that allows for the purification of map-HBHA, which could improve diagnostic tests and facilitate the study of pathogenicity.

The researchers developed a novel experimental method for Map culture (using a bioreactor instead of traditional flask culture) 2. They established a new purification technique for map-HBHA using specific chromatography steps 3. The method increases biomass yield (5-fold increase compared to classical culture) 4. The conclusion explicitly highlights the novelty of the approach by describing the optimized culture and purification technique 5. The method offers potential improvements in studying protein structure, pathogenicity, and diagnostic test development  The most specific sub-label that captures the novelty is ""New experimental method"" under the broader category of ""New research method"" within the ""Method and Material Novelty"" primary label."	The conclusion describes an optimized method for culturing Map in a bioreactor and purifying native map-HBHA using heparin-Sepharose chromatography, which represents a novel research methodology for protein isolation and characterization.				prompt-v2.txt	taxonomy-v0.1.txt
